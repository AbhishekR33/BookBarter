# 🔧 Mobile Connection Debug Steps

## 🔍 Step 1: Test Backend URLs Directly on Mobile

Open these URLs in your mobile browser:

### A. Test Main Backend
```
https://bookbarter-backend.onrender.com/
```
**Expected Result**: "📚 BookBarter API is running!"

### B. Test API Endpoint  
```
https://bookbarter-backend.onrender.com/api/users
```
**Expected Result**: JSON response or error message

### C. Test Login Endpoint
```
https://bookbarter-backend.onrender.com/api/users/login
```
**Expected Result**: Should show "Cannot GET" (normal for GET request)

## 🚨 If Any URL Fails on Mobile:

### Issue 1: Backend URL Wrong
- Check your actual Render URL
- Make sure it's exactly: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

### Issue 2: Mobile Network Blocking
- Try on WiFi vs Mobile Data
- Some networks block certain domains

### Issue 3: CORS Issue
- Backend might not allow your frontend domain

## 🔧 Quick Fixes:

### Fix 1: Update Axios with Exact URL
Tell me your exact Render backend URL and I'll update the code.

### Fix 2: Add Debugging
Let's add console logs to see what's happening.

### Fix 3: Check Vercel Environment Variables
- Go to Vercel Dashboard
- Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Add: `VITE_API_URL` = `https://your-exact-backend-url.onrender.com/api`

## 📱 Mobile Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Backend URL works in mobile browser
- [ ] Frontend deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Environment variable set in Vercel
- [ ] Mobile browser cache cleared
- [ ] Tried different network (WiFi/Mobile)

## 🎯 Next Steps:
1. Test backend URLs on mobile browser first
2. Tell me results + your exact Render URL
3. I'll provide specific fix
